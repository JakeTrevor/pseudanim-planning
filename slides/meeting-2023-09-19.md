# Agenda

- Project overview (What)
- Initial plan (how)

---

# What am I building?

The initial aim of this project is:

> Create a tool to animate arbitrary algorithms

More generally:

> parse pseudocode and turn it into an animation

this leads me to my proposed name:

---

# Pseudanim

---

## More specifically

- a webapp?
- a CLI tool?
- a package that turns code -> animation

---

# How to approach this?

As I have mentioned before, it makes sense to me to split this project into a few parts;

- A backend, which parses code and turns it into a intermediate representation
- A frontend, which accepts the IR, and produces a visual representation of it.

---

# Intermediate Representation

- The IR needs to represent the changing state of the computer.

- The most obvious way to do this is to store a series of computer states.
- They are 'key frames' in the animation, representing the 'state' of the computer

Therefore I will call them 'state frames'.

---

# Intermediate Representation

- The IR consists of a list of state frames

- A stateframe consist of a list of objects in computer memory.

For example here is what IR may look like:

```json
[
	[
		{literal: 'hello', key: 'k1'},
		{struct: {0: 'hello', 1: 'world', 2: {pointer:'k1'}}, key:'k2', label: 'var1'},
		{array: [1, 2, 3], key: 'k3', label: 'var2' },
		...
	],
]
```

---

# The five animation primitives

- strings & numbers (fundemental data)
- Arrays
- structs
- pointers
- variables (labels)

---

# Challenges

You may note, the way I have laid out my plan effectively makes this project an interpreter.
There is a major problem however that we must address at the architecture level:

---

# The halting problem

---

# The halting problem

- There is no way to know if the program will halt before executing it.
- Some programs therefore never end - and could not be be animated without some additional considerations

There are two strategies to handle this:

1. Limit how long program can run for. Could be set as a CLI flag or with a default.
2. Compile on demand (JIT Interperting); good for interactive apps where user can step through.

Ideally, both should be implemented.

# Layout problem

---

# Layout problem

Even if I have a list of objects, where should I place them?

- This is not too hard for simple cases (i.e. array sorting)
- but is _very important_ to get right for things like graph or tree algorithms.
  - not a trivial question when there are many pointers

---

# How do I build an interpreter?

Aside from some playing around in PLs, I'm not sure how to approach the backend either.

---

# Techstack?

- I propose Typescript/Javascript
  - I am familiar with it & it's ideally suited to developing interactive frontends
  - also not too hard to produce MP4s/gifs
- Tentatively suggest [Langium](https://langium.org/) for backend
  - Advice appreciated
  - MAJOR advatage: front & back in same language simplifies complexity significantly.
