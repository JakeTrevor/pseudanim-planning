# Progress

This week I have:

- written out insertion sort in 'pseudocode'
- written a basic grammar that accepts that program
- started writing basic code generation
    - I have skipped semantic analysis (for now)
    - Simple expression parsing only

---

# Progress

This week I have:

- Spoken to Simon Fowler
    - He has give me a book to read on types
    - This should help me with my biggest problem:

---

# Expressions

Expressions are very hard; Right now I have two problems:

---

1. Order of operations

My grammar does not parse expressions into a sensible AST structure, reading stricly left-to-right

---

2. Expression types

The grammar accepts totally nonsensicle statements, such as: 

```
true < false
```

This is solvable with a type system, but that begs the question:

---

# How to implement types

Having spoken to Simon, I should avoid trying to create a typed expression grammar/AST

Instead:
1. create untyped expression grammar
2. perform a semantic type-checking step later

I am reading through 'Types and Programming Languages' as advised

However this still leaves us with some questions:

---

# Type questions

1. How strict should types be?
2. How should type annotations be written
3. When should type annotations be required?

---

# Next Steps:

I will continue to work on the backend.
- Focus may shift to static analysis (types) as this will facilitate easier expression evaluation
- Expressions are hard; statements are relatively easy.
